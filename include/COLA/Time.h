/**
 * \brief	How COLA views time
 *
 * COLA::Time is a singleton object that makes a best effort at controlling the flow of time inside the program. For now, this is
 * not written with actual real-time kernel usage. Essentially, the object "burns" time when the loop rate exceeds a pre designated
 * FPS. It also contains a flag set when the loop time is above the current fps (the program is lagging).
 *
 * Time has two modes, live and offline. The mode setting affects how time will externally report time. In offline mode, we assume that
 * the data source is a video file. Thus, the time elapsed between frames is independent of the programs run time. Thus, time reports the
 * elapsed time between to frames as the difference in frame number multiplied by the inverse of frames per second. In live mode, the
 * object returns the actual clock difference between the two frames.
